    "# T1485 - Data Destruction",
    "\n",
    "Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives.(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Unit 42 Shamoon3 2018)(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018) Common operating system file deletion commands such as <code>del</code> and <code>rm</code> often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from [Disk Content Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/001) and [Disk Structure Wipe](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1561/002) because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.\n\nAdversaries may attempt to overwrite files and directories with randomly generated data to make it irrecoverable.(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Unit 42 Shamoon3 2018) In some cases politically oriented image files have been used to overwrite data.(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)\n\nTo maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [Valid Accounts](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078), [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003), and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002).(Citation: Symantec Shamoon 2012)(Citation: FireEye Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Palo Alto Shamoon Nov 2016)(Citation: Kaspersky StoneDrill 2017)(Citation: Talos Olympic Destroyer 2018)"

    "## Shield Active Defense\n### Backup and Recovery \n Make copies of key system software, configuration, and data to enable rapid system restoration. \n\n Employ disk imaging, system backup, or file synchronization tools to create copies of key data on a protected backup repository.  This is typically done to capture/restore an entire system or major subsystems.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to test what an adversary might do if destroyed data is selectively replaced by the defender.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can ensure data is backed up on a regular basis and backups are stored offline from the system.  If an adversary is detected destroying or altering data, the defender could selectively restore data from backup to see how the adversary reacts.\n#### Procedures\nBackup data on public facing websites and retain the files offline. In the event of data damage or loss, restore the data from backup.\nBackup data on an end-user system and store offline.  If an adversary alters or deletes data on the system, restore the data using the backup copy.\nIn an adversary engagement situation, if an adversary deletes or alters files on a machine they are controlling, restore the data to it original state and location to see how the adversary reacts."
