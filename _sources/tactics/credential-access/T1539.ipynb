    "# T1539 - Steal Web Session Cookie",
    "\n",
    "An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.\n\nCookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems. Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services). Session cookies can be used to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.(Citation: Pass The Cookie)\n\nThere are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system.(Citation: Kaspersky TajMahal April 2019)(Citation: Unit 42 Mac Crypto Cookies January 2019) There are also open source frameworks such as Evilginx 2 and Muraena that can gather session cookies through a man-in-the-middle proxy that can be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.(Citation: Github evilginx2)(Citation: GitHub Mauraena)\n\nAfter an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a [Web Session Cookie](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1506) technique to login to the corresponding web application."

    "## Shield Active Defense\n### Security Controls \n Alter security controls to make the system more or less vulnerable to attack. \n\n Manipulating security controls involves making configuration changes to the security settings of a system including things like modifying Group Policies, disabling/enabling autorun for removable media, and tightening or relaxing system firewalls, etc.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to use security controls to stop or allow an adversary's activity.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can harden authentication mechanisms to ensure having just a session cookie is not enough to authenticate with another system.\n#### Procedures\nWeaken security controls on a system to allow for leaking of credentials via network connection poisoning.\nImplement policies on a system to prevent the insecure storage of passwords in the registry. This may force an adversary to revert these changes or find another way to access cached credentials."
