    "\n",
    "Adversaries may transfer tools or other files between systems in a compromised environment. Files may be copied from one system to another to stage adversary tools or other files over the course of an operation. Adversaries may copy files laterally between internal victim systems to support lateral movement using inherent file sharing protocols such as file sharing over SMB to connected network shares or with authenticated connections with [SMB/Windows Admin Shares](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/002) or [Remote Desktop Protocol](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/001). Files can also be copied over on Mac and Linux with native tools like scp, rsync, and sftp."

    "Monitor for file creation and files transferred within a network using protocols such as SMB. Unusual processes with internal network connections creating files on-system may be suspicious. Consider monitoring for abnormal usage of utilities and command-line arguments that may be used in support of remote transfer of files. Considering monitoring for alike file hashes or characteristics (ex: filename) that are created on multiple hosts."

    "# Shield Active Defense\n### Network Monitoring \n Monitor network traffic in order to detect adversary activity. \n\n Network monitoring involves capturing network activity data, including capturing of server, firewall, and other relevant logs. A defender can then review them or send them to a centralized collection location for further analysis.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to monitor network traffic for different protocols, anomalous traffic patterns, transfer of data, etc. to determine the presence of an adversary.\n#### Use Case\nThe defender can implement network monitoring for and alert on  anomalous traffic patterns, large  or unexpected data transfers, and other activity that may reveal the presence of an adversary.\n#### Procedures\nCapture network logs for internet-facing devices and send those logs to a central collection location.\nCapture all network  device (router, switches, proxy, etc.) logs on a decoy network and send those logs to a central collection location."
