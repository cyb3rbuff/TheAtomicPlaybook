    "\n",
    "Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself."

If a remote access tool is used in this manner to move laterally, then additional actions are likely to occur after execution, such as opening network connections for Command and Control and system and network information Discovery."

    "# Shield Active Defense\n### System Activity Monitoring \n Collect system activity logs which can reveal adversary activity. \n\n Capturing system logs can show logins, user and system events, etc.  Collecting this data and potentially sending it to a centralized location can help reveal the presence of an adversary and the actions they perform on a compromised system.\n#### Opportunity\nThere is an opportunity to deploy a tripwire that triggers an alert when an adversary touches a network resource or uses a specific technique.\n#### Use Case\nA defender can monitor systems for the use of removeable media.\n#### Procedures\nEnsure that systems capture and retain common system level activity artifacts that might be produced.\nMonitor Windows systems for event codes that reflect an adversary changing passwords, adding accounts to groups, etc."
