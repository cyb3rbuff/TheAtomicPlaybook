<h1>Initial Access<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-access" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The adversary is trying to get into your network.</p>
<p>Initial Access consists of techniques that use various entry vectors to gain their initial foothold within a network. Techniques used to gain a foothold include targeted spearphishing and exploiting weaknesses on public-facing web servers. Footholds gained through initial access may allow for continued access, like valid accounts and use of external remote services, or may be limited-use due to changing passwords.</p>

Cloud accounts are those created and configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration of resources within a cloud service provider or SaaS application. In some cases, cloud accounts may be federated with traditional identity management system, such as Window Active Directory.(Citation: AWS Identity Federation)(Citation: Google Federating GC)(Citation: Microsoft Deploying AD Federation)</p></td>

<p>Compromised credentials for cloud accounts can be used to harvest sensitive data from online storage accounts and databases. Access to cloud accounts can also be abused to gain Initial Access to a network by abusing a <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1199">Trusted Relationship</a>. Similar to <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078/002">Domain Accounts</a>, compromise of federated cloud accounts may allow adversaries to more easily move laterally within an environment.
T1078.003 | Local Accounts | Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a local account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Local accounts are those configured by an organization for use by users, remote support, services, or for administration on a single system or service.</p>
<p>Local Accounts may also be abused to elevate privileges and harvest credentials through <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003">OS Credential Dumping</a>. Password reuse may allow the abuse of local accounts across a set of machines on a network for the purposes of Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement.
T1078.002 | Domain Accounts | Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a domain account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. (Citation: TechNet Credential Theft) Domain accounts are those managed by Active Directory Domain Services where access and permissions are configured across systems and services that are part of that domain. Domain accounts can cover users, administrators, and services.(Citation: Microsoft AD Accounts)</p>
<p>Adversaries may compromise domain accounts, some with a high level of privileges, through various means such as <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003">OS Credential Dumping</a> or password reuse, allowing access to privileged resources of the domain.
T1078.001 | Default Accounts | Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems or default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices.(Citation: Microsoft Local Accounts Feb 2019)</p>
<p>Default accounts are not limited to client machines, rather also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices and computer applications whether they are internal, open source, or commercial. Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation, as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also utilize publicly disclosed or stolen <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1552/004">Private Keys</a> or credential materials to legitimately connect to remote environments via <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021">Remote Services</a>.(Citation: Metasploit SSH Module)
T1195.003 | Compromise Hardware Supply Chain | Adversaries may manipulate hardware components in products prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. By modifying hardware or firmware in the supply chain, adversaries can insert a backdoor into consumer networks that may be difficult to detect and give the adversary a high degree of control over the system. Hardware backdoors may be inserted into various devices, such as servers, workstations, network infrastructure, or peripherals.
T1195.002 | Compromise Software Supply Chain | Adversaries may manipulate application software prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Supply chain compromise of software can take place in a number of ways, including manipulation of the application source code, manipulation of the update/distribution mechanism for that software, or replacing compiled releases with a modified version.</p>
<p>Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.(Citation: Avast CCleaner3 2018) (Citation: Command Five SK 2011)<br />
T1195.001 | Compromise Software Dependencies and Development Tools | Adversaries may manipulate software dependencies and development tools prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise. Applications often depend on external software to function properly. Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency. (Citation: Trendmicro NPM Compromise)</p>
<p>Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set or may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims.
T1566.003 | Spearphishing via Service | Adversaries may send spearphishing messages via third-party services in an attempt to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing via service is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than directly via enterprise email channels.</p>
<p>All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services. These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target’s interest in some way. Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities. Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that’s running in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.</p>
<p>A common example is to build rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail service that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more likely to open the file since it’s something they were expecting. If the payload doesn’t work as expected, the adversary can continue normal communications and troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working.
T1566.002 | Spearphishing Link | Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments.</p>
<p>All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveraging <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204">User Execution</a>. The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place. Adversaries may also include links that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly or verify the receipt of an email (i.e. web bugs/web beacons). Links may also direct users to malicious applications  designed to <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528">Steal Application Access Token</a>s, like OAuth tokens, in order to gain access to protected applications and information.(Citation: Trend Micro Pawn Storm OAuth 2017)
T1566.001 | Spearphishing Attachment | Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204">User Execution</a> to gain execution.</p>
<p>There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary’s payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user’s system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one.
T1566 | Phishing | Adversaries may send phishing messages to elicit sensitive information and/or gain access to victim systems. All forms of phishing are electronically delivered social engineering. Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.</p>
<p>Adversaries may send victim’s emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems or to gather credentials for use of <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078">Valid Accounts</a>. Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms.
T1190 | Exploit Public-Facing Application | Adversaries may attempt to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. The weakness in the system can be a bug, a glitch, or a design vulnerability. These applications are often websites, but can include databases (like SQL)(Citation: NVD CVE-2016-6662), standard services (like SMB(Citation: CIS Multiple SMB Vulnerabilities) or SSH), and any other applications with Internet accessible open sockets, such as web servers and related services.(Citation: NVD CVE-2014-7169) Depending on the flaw being exploited this may include <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1211">Exploitation for Defense Evasion</a>.</p>
<p>If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud APIs or to take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.</p>
<p>For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.(Citation: OWASP Top 10)(Citation: CWE top 25)
T1189 | Drive-by Compromise | Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user’s web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1550/001">Application Access Token</a>.</p>
<p>Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting.</p></li>
<li><p>Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers.</p></li>
<li><p>Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client (e.g. forum posts, comments, and other user controllable web content).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted attack is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. There are several known examples of this occurring.(Citation: Shadowserver Strategic Web Compromise)</p>
<p>Typical drive-by compromise process:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.</p></li>
<li><p>Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser.</p></li>
<li><p>If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user’s system unless other protections are in place.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1190">Exploit Public-Facing Application</a>, the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website. This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.</p>
<p>Adversaries may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed to <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1528">Steal Application Access Token</a>s, like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information. These malicious applications have been delivered through popups on legitimate websites.(Citation: Volexity OceanLotus Nov 2017)
T1200 | Hardware Additions | Adversaries may introduce computer accessories, computers, or networking hardware into a system or network that can be used as a vector to gain access. While public references of usage by APT groups are scarce, many penetration testers leverage hardware additions for initial access. Commercial and open source products are leveraged with capabilities such as passive network tapping (Citation: Ossmann Star Feb 2011), man-in-the middle encryption breaking (Citation: Aleks Weapons Nov 2015), keystroke injection (Citation: Hak5 RubberDuck Dec 2016), kernel memory reading via DMA (Citation: Frisk DMA August 2016), adding new wireless access to an existing network (Citation: McMillan Pwn March 2012), and others.
T1195 | Supply Chain Compromise | Adversaries may manipulate products or product delivery mechanisms prior to receipt by a final consumer for the purpose of data or system compromise.</p>
<p>Supply chain compromise can take place at any stage of the supply chain including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Manipulation of development tools</p></li>
<li><p>Manipulation of a development environment</p></li>
<li><p>Manipulation of source code repositories (public or private)</p></li>
<li><p>Manipulation of source code in open-source dependencies</p></li>
<li><p>Manipulation of software update/distribution mechanisms</p></li>
<li><p>Compromised/infected system images (multiple cases of removable media infected at the factory) (Citation: IBM Storwize) (Citation: Schneider Electric USB Malware)</p></li>
<li><p>Replacement of legitimate software with modified versions</p></li>
<li><p>Sales of modified/counterfeit products to legitimate distributors</p></li>
<li><p>Shipment interdiction</p></li>
</ul>
<p>While supply chain compromise can impact any component of hardware or software, attackers looking to gain execution have often focused on malicious additions to legitimate software in software distribution or update channels. (Citation: Avast CCleaner3 2018) (Citation: Microsoft Dofoil 2018) (Citation: Command Five SK 2011) Targeting may be specific to a desired victim set (Citation: Symantec Elderwood Sept 2012) or malicious software may be distributed to a broad set of consumers but only move on to additional tactics on specific victims. (Citation: Avast CCleaner3 2018) (Citation: Command Five SK 2011) Popular open source projects that are used as dependencies in many applications may also be targeted as a means to add malicious code to users of the dependency. (Citation: Trendmicro NPM Compromise)
T1199 | Trusted Relationship | Adversaries may breach or otherwise leverage organizations who have access to intended victims. Access through trusted third party relationship exploits an existing connection that may not be protected or receives less scrutiny than standard mechanisms of gaining access to a network.</p>
<p>Organizations often grant elevated access to second or third-party external providers in order to allow them to manage internal systems as well as cloud-based environments. Some examples of these relationships include IT services contractors, managed security providers, infrastructure contractors (e.g. HVAC, elevators, physical security). The third-party provider’s access may be intended to be limited to the infrastructure being maintained, but may exist on the same network as the rest of the enterprise. As such, <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078">Valid Accounts</a> used by the other party for access to internal network systems may be compromised and used.
T1133 | External Remote Services | Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1021/006">Windows Remote Management</a> can also be used externally.</p>
<p>Access to <a class="reference external" href="https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1078">Valid Accounts</a> to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network.(Citation: Volexity Virtual Private Keylogging) Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.
T1091 | Replication Through Removable Media | Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media’s firmware itself.
T1078 | Valid Accounts | Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access and remote desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.</p>
<p>The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.
